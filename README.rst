This code accompanies the paper [1]_ and implements the code for estimating the region of attraction for a policy and optimizing the policy subject to stability constraints. For the old numpy-based code to estimate the region of attraction in [2]_ see the `lyapunov-learning <https://github.com/befelix/lyapunov-learning>`_ repository. The code for learning Lyapunov functions from [3]_ can be found in the `examples <./examples>`_ folder.

Getting started
---------------

You can install the library by cloning the repository and installing it with

``pip install . --process-dependency-links``

To run the tests in `scripts/test_code.sh`, you need to install additional dependencies with

``pip install .[test] --process-dependency-links``

The ``--process-dependency-links`` flag is needed to install ``gpflow==0.4.0``, which is not on pypi. You can skip it if that particular version of the library is already installed.

You can the find example jupyter notebooks and the experiments in the paper in the `examples <./examples>`_ folder.
